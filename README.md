## GENII

This is the Pytorch implementation of GEMII in the paper: [GENII: A Graph Neural Network-based Model for Citywide Litter Prediction Leveraging Crowdsensing Data]. 

The baseline's code are all in the folder *baseline*. the data preprocessing code and chart drawing code can be found in the folder *code_preliminary* for reference.

The initial dataset is in the folder *data_base*, and the processed dataset can be downloaded at  [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KPFUvCb5ihQSvZZRYr2pvw?). 

## Requirements

* pytorch

* sklearn

* python 3

* jupyter notebook

  

## Usage

To run the code 

1.  Need to download the processed dataset firstly at  [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KPFUvCb5ihQSvZZRYr2pvw?). 

2. cd to *code_model* : ` python model_train.py`
